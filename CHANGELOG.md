# CHANGELOG

### v0.5.0 (---)

- Breaking-change: renamed `gen_resource_path` to `gen_serveable_path`.
Additionally, this function now generates file names without extension when
an empty string is passed to extension, which is now the default value of the
argument.
- New: Widget `file_uploader()`.
- New: Function `make_serveable_copy()`.
- New: Function `move_to_serveable_dir()`.
- New: A `.gitignore` file is now automatically generated within `.Magic` if
it doesn't exist.
- New: `build-third.sh` script to build all third party libraries using docker.
- Change: if a non-serveable path is passed to `image()` and the path points
to an existing file, a serveable copy is automatically created using
`make_serveable_copy()`.
- Change: Dry-run errors do not kill the server anymore. Rather, the user can
see the error when accessing the web app, and work on the fix while using the
hot-reloading mechanism.
- Performance: The temporary module where the user script is evaluated is now
session-persistent rather then recreated on every rerun.
- Deprecated: `@once` macro is deprecated, as it turns out it is not needed now
that the app module is session-persistent.

### v0.4.2 (2026-01-22)

- Updates documentation installation instructions now that the package is
registered in the julia General registry.
- Bug-fix: Fixes catch block of rerun not reporting the error to the user.
https://github.com/nidoro/Magic.jl/issues/7
- Bug-fix: After introduction of the `docs_path` argument to `start_app()` on
v0.3.0, we didn't update the CLI arguments to mirror that change.

### v0.4.1 (2026-01-20)

- Hot-fix: Fixes server crash after session is closed
https://github.com/nidoro/Magic.jl/issues/6

### v0.4.0 (2026-01-18)

- Breaking-change: Package name change from Lit.jl to Magic.jl.
- New: Introduced `lifetime` argument to `gen_resource_path()`.

### v0.3.2 (2026-01-16)

- Hot-fix: examples and CHANGELOG.

### v0.3.1 (2026-01-16)

- Bug-fix: Unqueued rerun request are now validated as well.
- Bug-fix: Implemented invalid state acknoledgment system, to avoid this
situation:
    1. Client sends 2 events in a row. The second is invalid, given the first
    one. Invalid state is sent from server to client.
    2. Before receiving the invalid state message, the client sends a third
    event, which is valid. Then restores old state and unfades.
    3. The server processes the new event and returns the newer state.
    4. An update then happens in the client, which is unnexpected, because the
    return from transparency should mean that all events have been processed,
    and there are no other ones in queue.
- Cache-busting: Introduced cache-busting system. Generated HTML pages now use
cache-bustable links to resources that are likely to change from version to
version of Lit.
- New logo.

### v0.3.0 (2026-01-11)

- Breaking-change: Lit is distributed with its own docs, but not with its built
docs, so in order for it to be served, the user has to specify a path where it
has been built. So we added the ability to do so. Now `start_path()`, instead of
accepting a `docs::Bool`, accepts a `docs_path::String`.
- Bug-fix: Invalid URIs used to return HTTP status 200 with empty HTML. That
has been fixed to return 404 and a proper 404.html page.
- Bug-fix: To-Do now handles `nothing` as a possible value returned by the
text box. [Issue #4](https://github.com/nidoro/Lit.jl/issues/4)

### v0.2.4 (2026-01-10)

- Hot-fix: solved liblit.so compatibility issues with older linux versions.

### v0.2.3 (2026-01-10)

- Added Windows 64-bit support.
- Brazil's forecast example now downloads the shape file if it doesn't exist.

### v0.2.2 (2026-01-06)

- Bug-fix: rerun requests are now serialized in the back and front-ends.
- Bug-fix: implemented proper paste behaviour for `dataframe`.
