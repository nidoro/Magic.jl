# @page_startup

Macro to define a code block that should only be executed at the startup (dry-run) of the current page being run (i.e. the page associated with the URL path returned by `get_url_path()`). Usage:

```julia
@page_startup begin
    # page initialization logic
end
```

Internally, this macro is implemented by checking the result of [`is_page_first_pass()`](/docs/build/docs/api-reference/application-logic/is_app_first_pass-func) and running the `@page_startup` code block only if it returns `true`.

## Usage

You can define multiple `@page_startup` code blocks, but we recommend you to keep all of your page initialization logic inside a single `@page_startup` block near the top of your page script file (or, if you have all of your pages in a single file, near the top of where the page's logic begins).

Although pages are not required to have `@page_startup` code blocks, some initialization tasks should be only performed inside `@page_startup` code blocks. See below what you are expected to do inside `@page_startup` code blocks.

### 1. Page static settings

Page static settings are persistent settings that are defined at the page's dry-run and that cannot be changed later. These include the page title, description, extra fonts and extra styles. The static settings related functions below can only be called inside `@page_startup` blocks (see [Page static settings](/docs/build/docs/api-reference/application-logic/set_title-func) to learn more).

  * `set_title()`
  * `set_description()`
  * `add_font()`
  * `add_css_rule()`

Example:

```julia
@page_startup begin
    set_title("My Magic App")
    set_description("An awesome app built with Magic.jl")
end
```

Internally, these static settings are used to build the static HTML that is served when a user accesses the page's URL.

### 2. Initialization of page persistent data

Page persistent data is a user defined data that is bound to a page and whose lifetime is the lifetime of the app, i.e., as long as the app is running the data will persist. Page persistent data can be retrieved at any moment using `get_page_data()` and is shared accross sessions.

You can store data that you want to be available to all the sessions of a page via the `set_page_data()` function, and retrieve it using the `get_page_data()` function. See [Page persistent data](/docs/build/docs/api-reference/application-logic/set_page_data-func) to learn more.
