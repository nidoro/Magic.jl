# App persistent data

App persistent data is an user defined data whose lifetime is the lifetime of
the app, i.e., as long as the app is running the data will persist. App
persistent data can be retrieved at any moment using `get_app_data()` and is
shared accross pages and sessions.

Although the app persistent data can be either mutable or immutable, a common
practice is to define a mutable struct to store all of your app's data and store
it with `set_app_data()` at the application startup. Example:

```julia
# Define the struct to hold the app persistent data
mutable struct AppData
    foo::String
    bar::Int
end

@app_startup begin
    # Initialize the app persistent data
    app = AppData("hello", 32)
    set_app_data(app)
end

# now `get_app_data()` can be called from anywhere to retrieve the app data
```

In the example above, since the persistent data is a mutable struct, every time
`get_app_data()` is called the same `AppData` object instance stored with
`set_app_data()` at the app startup is returned, and thus you can modify its
members without having to call `set_app_data()` ever again.

## `set_app_data()`

Stores app persistent data.

### Function Signature

```julia
function set_app_data(app_data::Any)::Nothing
```

 Argument  | Description
---------- |-------------
 `app_data` | Data of `Any` type.

## `get_app_data()`

Retrieves the previously stored app persistent data.

### Function Signature

```julia
function get_app_data()::Any
```
